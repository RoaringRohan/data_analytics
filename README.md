# 📊📈📉 Data Analytics

Data Analytics is used across most if not, all companies in the 21st century. It helps various teams guage a better idea of how their company is performing with retrospect to their data. Data Analytics not only encompasses the idea of taking a dataset and performing calculations to it to achieve a certain metric, but it's also about how data analysts present their findings. I made this a project of mine to practice performing data analysis on various datasets from the internet (mainly Kaggle and Live API's) and to present them with Power BI.

## 📦 Technologies

- `Python`
- `Pandas`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
- `MySQL`
- `Power BI`

## 🦄 Features

Here's what you can do with the various Data Analytics Projects I've completed:

- **View the Dashboards**: I've created Power BI dashboards to summarize some of the findings I got when analyzing the datasets.

- **Examine the ETL process**: I make it a goal for each project to try to implement more optimized processes than I had in the previous projects. Take a look for yourself!

- **Admire the Organization**: Taken from some of the industry experts in my previous internship, I came to learn of one of the most organized structures of having code and notebooks set up for debugging and analysis purposes.

## 👩🏽‍🍳 The Process

I started by learning how the Extract-Transform-Load process looked like from an enterprise perspective. From the beginning my goal was to be able to create code that can easily be interpreted and used by a team of analysts.

Next, I learned about ways of moving data after it goes through the notebooks into a database, and in most cases I used MySQL as my database to store the data.

After that, I taught myself how to create effective, and presentable Power BI dashboards which pulled the data out of the database.

Once I had done this a few times, I began to learn new ways to optimize this process and make my code more efficient.

## 📚 What I Learned

During this project, I've picked up important skills and a better understanding of how data analysis works.

### 📈 Overall Growth:

Each part of this project helped me understand more about the role that data plays in a company, and how analyzing it can help improve the business goals of a company more effectively than any other metric that is currently available.

## 💭 How can it be improved?

- Using Numpy and MatPlotLib to do further analysis through Python and discover even more interesting metrics than just the ones that Power BI provides.
- Beginning to use Machine Learning Algorithms to help discover patterns in the data that may not be found with the naked eye.

## 🚦 Running the Project

To run the project in your local environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Follow the instructions for installing libraries using pip install found in the instructions.md file of this repo.
3. Now you can either open the dashboards within the projects into Power BI to view the insights, or run the SQL dump files into MySQL to view the data. Or even run jupyter notebook to view all of the code I wrote in the ETL processes.
